implement (let name args body) better (with (lambda (x) (x x)))

why do we delay char input?


DONE or failed:

use delay instead of dummy lambdas for if
  this does not work because abstraction elimination does not
  preserve the semantics of d

can we adopt unlambda's native booleans (i and v) instead of our own
bools?
